**Beatlocker** is a fast and lightweight Subsonic server. It is unfinished and should not be used yet.

## App compatibility

Beatlocker has been tested (and found mostly working!) with:
* [Airsonic-refix](https://github.com/tamland/airsonic-refix)
* [D-Sub](https://github.com/daneren2005/Subsonic)
* [Symfonium](https://symfonium.app)
